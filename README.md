## 🎯 Tasks Overview  

### 🔹 Task 1: Linear Regression Model
- Built a simple **Linear Regression model**.  
- Implemented using Python libraries (NumPy, scikit-learn).  
- Learned about supervised learning and regression.  
- **Deliverable:** `LinearRegression.ipynb`  

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Classification Model
- Implemented a **classification algorithm** on labeled dataset.  
- Preprocessed data, trained and evaluated the model.  
- Used metrics like Accuracy and Confusion Matrix.  
- **Deliverable:** `Classification.ipynb`  

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Build a Neural Network
- Developed a **Neural Network from scratch** using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**.  
- Trained on structured data and tested accuracy.  
- Understood activation functions, layers, and optimization.  
- **Deliverable:** `NeuralNetwork.ipynb`  

---

### 🔹 Task 4: Build a Custom Image Classifier
- Used **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2).  
- Fine-tuned the model on a **custom dataset** for image classification.  
- Explored concepts like feature extraction and fine-tuning.  
- **Deliverable:** `CustomImageClassifier.ipynb`  

---

### 🔹 Task 5: Develop an AI-Powered Web App
- Built a **Streamlit Web App** that allows users to upload images.  
- Integrated the trained model from Task 4 for live predictions.  
- Showcases how ML models can be deployed in real-world applications.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - `app.py` → Web app code  
  - `model.h5` → Saved trained model

## ⚙️ Requirements  

Install the following dependencies before running tasks:  

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install pillow
pip install streamlit

How to Run
📘 Tasks 1–4 (Jupyter/Colab Notebooks)

Open the respective .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially to train and test the model.

🌐 Task 5 (Streamlit App)

Ensure model.h5 is placed in the same folder as app.py.

Run the app using:

streamlit run app.py


Upload an image → get predictions in the browser.

📌 Notes

Tasks progress from basic ML (Linear Regression) → Deep Learning (Neural Networks, Transfer Learning) → Deployment (Web App).

Final web app demonstrates end-to-end AI project deployment.
